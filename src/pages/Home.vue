      <p>
        Prompt was a workflow management tool created in house for the now
        defunct energy supplier npower, it utilised .net and SQL in the backend
        and Razor Pages/JQuery in the frontend. Prompt was designed and
        developed by myself and one other developer, it was rolled out in house
        at npower and its offshore partners TCS and Capita in 2018 and achieved
        massive productivity improvements across the business. In 2021, npower
        ceased trading due to a takeover from another energy supplier who
        recognised the massive benefits of our system immediately, initial talks
        were had to bring Prompt over to the new supplier but they ultimately
        collapsed and development has now ceased.
